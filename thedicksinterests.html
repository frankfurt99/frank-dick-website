<h1>LEGOS</h1>

<P>I have been interested in the concept of LEGOs for more than decade now, and it's safe to say; What I barely thought upon the brand during my early youth, has since expanded into what I will plan to make one of my prominent hobbies, particularly and only collecting the adult/18+ rated sets at that.

One of the first LEGO sets I personally bought myself was a miniature, Oracle Red Bull Racing RB20 F1 Car, which sits at approximately 30 bucks, hence how it comes with 250 pieces.</p>

<h1>ART AND ANIMATION</h1>

<p>Let's get this out of the way. I have been drawing for nearly my entire life, and from the looks of it, this awesome hobby of mine won't cease anytime soon.

I have been animating since the age of 10, and have since significantly improved in overall animation quality; In the topic of improvments, I'm only optimistic the improvments shall improve</p>

<h1>VIDEOGRAPHY AND PHOTOGRAPHY</h1>

<p>I have specifically been interested in making my own portfolio of videography ever since the age of 8, which is pretty unexpected since we probably don't hear other 8 year olds wanting to make their own recorded videos these days. I'm glad I was one of them.

    My growing interest of videography has eventually led me to the wonders of photography, beginning when I took somes photos of miscellaneous insects crawling upon my room walls with my Galaxy.

    I will never stop making videos or taking pictures. I love doing both.
