<h1>1: LEGOS <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/wB2RW96Q/2x2legobrick.gif" length="50" width="50"></h1>

<P>I have been interested in the concept of LEGOs for more than decade now, and it's safe to say; What I barely thought upon the brand during my early youth, has since expanded into what I will plan to make one of my prominent hobbies, particularly and only collecting the adult/18+ rated sets at that.

One of the first LEGO sets I personally bought myself was a miniature, Oracle Red Bull Racing RB20 F1 Car, which sits at approximately 30 bucks, hence how it comes with 250 pieces.</p>

<h1>2: ART AND ANIMATION</h1>

<p>Let's get this out of the way. I have been drawing for nearly my entire life, and from the looks of it, this awesome hobby of mine won't cease anytime soon.

I have been animating since the age of 10, and have since significantly improved in overall animation quality; In the topic of improvments, I'm only optimistic the improvments shall improve</p>

<h1>3: VIDEOGRAPHY AND PHOTOGRAPHY</h1>

<p>I have specifically been interested in making my own portfolio of videography ever since the age of 8, which is pretty unexpected since we probably don't hear other 8 year olds wanting to make their own recorded videos these days. I'm glad I was one of them.

    My growing interest of videography has eventually led me to the wonders of photography, beginning when I took somes photos of miscellaneous insects crawling upon my room walls with my Galaxy.

    I will never stop making videos or taking pictures. I love doing both.

    <h1>3B: CAMERAS</h1>

    Particularly in my early years, I always resorted to make use of a phone camera, though, I have since sought the use of other devices capable of the same thing, duh. At the age of 14, I went into this phase where I wanted my own camcorder to record videos with. I would sometimes stay up at night, take out the ol' 'puter, and go on eBay, searching for any kind of Camcorder up for sale or auction. It could've been any one, I didn't care.

    <h2>SPOILER ALERT: I never bought one...</h2>
