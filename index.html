    <h1>THE EMPORIUM OF FRANK DICK</h1>
    <h2>Dick is my middle name.</h2>

    this is an attempt at the creation of a website by <b>Frank Dick!</b>

    <p>I am a teenage boy aiming to become succesful at some point in life: The thing is, i'm not exactly the luckiest guy you'll meet, 
     so anything can always go down easily, albeit you can argue that success can get in the way of luck, nor will luck be associated 
    with bringing anything down.</p>

    <p>I'll try goddammit.</p>

    <h1>INTERESTS</h1>
    <h2>I am appreciative of Technology and Electronic Devices, LEGOs, the art of drawing and animating, Video Games, taking a stroll, thus certifiably
        touching grass, learning upon Lolcows and other weirdos on the internet, watching entitled bastards receive Karma on video, and attempting
        to do cool things.</h2>

    <p>See you filthy animals soon. (Oh crap, I'm also one, talk about hypocrisy.)</p>
